# 42piscine

From 14th of Aug 2023 to 8th of september 2023 I have participated in the Piscine (a 4 week trial based on which students are selected
) of 42 Wolfsburg, a software engineering school in Wolfsburg, Germany.

I have been able to succesfully pass the Piscine, and received the opportunity to join the school as a full time student.

This repository contains all the projects (excluding exams) that I have been able to complete in a 4 week-time period.
